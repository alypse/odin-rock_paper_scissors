# Odin - Rock, Paper, Scissors

Rock, paper, scissors game project for The Odin Project - Foundations course.


## The project depended on some basic skills;
- DOM manipulation
- Functions
- HTML and CSS basics


## Potential iterations for later;
- A 'start game' method which initialises the match interface
- A distinct 'game over' view which has more explicit visual cues for the match outcome, and a method to restart the match
- A general cleanup and visual improvement effort
- Update visual assets...or an option to define the game (winning score, option names, image uploads for options!)
